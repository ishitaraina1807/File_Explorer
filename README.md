# Rust File Explorer

This is a simple file explorer written in Rust that lists the files in a specified directory.

## Description

The file explorer project is a command-line tool that allows users to list the files in a directory specified by the user. It utilizes Rust's standard library (`std::fs`) to interact with the file system and retrieve directory contents.

## Features

- List files in a specified directory.
- Handle errors gracefully when encountering issues while reading the directory.

## Installation

## Usage

1. Navigate to the directory where the project is cloned.
2. Compile the project using Cargo:

    ```

3. Run the executable, providing the directory path you want to explore:

    ```bash
    ./target/release/file_explorer <directory_path>
    ```

    Replace `<directory_path>` with the path to the directory you want to explore.
